                <p>
                I am Julian, an a Cybersecurity enthusiast from the sunny island of Singapore! My educational background is in Computer Forensics, with a strong interest in exploitation. Hence, I can be considered a "Purple Team" kinda guy.<br><br>
				Professionally, I have performed penetration testing, threat hunting, digital forensics, configuration reviews, audits and more. I also have the capability to perform malware analysis and some simple engineering if required. <br><br>
				Over time as I continue to learn new things, I hope to share some of my knowledge and experiences though this platform. I will also post and share new updates on my LinkedIn profile(click below!) on occasion, so do connect with me there!
				<br><br>
				Within my articles you may find that I show support for certain companies, software, courses(paid or free) etc. Please know that these are my personal opinions and thoughts, and that I am not affliated with them nor do I gain any benefit from sharing them.
				Regardless of how you ended up here, I thank you for visiting my page and I sincerely hope that the content I post provides value to you.
				<br>
				Cheers!<br>
