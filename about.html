                I am Julian, an a Cybersecurity enthusiast from the sunny island of Singapore! My educational background is in Computer Forensics, with a strong interest in exploitation. Currently I am working as part of a Red Team for a global firm doing what I love and enjoy.<br><br>
				Professionally, I have performed Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting, Digital Forensics, Configuration Reviews and more for clients across various sectors. I also have the capability to perform malware analysis and some simple reversing if required. <br><br>
				Over time as I continue to learn new things, I hope to share some of my knowledge and experiences though this platform. I will also post and share new updates on my LinkedIn profile(click below!) on occasion, so do connect with me there!
				<br><br>
				Within my articles you may find that I show support for certain companies, software, courses(paid or free) etc. Please know that these are my personal opinions and thoughts, and that I am not affliated with them nor do I gain any benefit from sharing them.
				Regardless of how you ended up here, I thank you for visiting my page and I sincerely hope that the content I post provides value to you. Should you feel the need, do reach out to me via <a href="mailto:J@0x4a.rocks">email</a>.				<br><br>
