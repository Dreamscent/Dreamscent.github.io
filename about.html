                I am Julian, an a Cybersecurity enthusiast from the sunny island of Singapore! My educational background is in Computer Forensics, with a strong interest in exploitation. Hence, I can be considered a "Purple Team" kinda guy.<br><br>
				Professionally, I have performed penetration testing, threat hunting, digital forensics, configuration reviews, audits and more. I also have the capability to perform malware analysis and some simple engineering if required. Over time as I continue to learn new things, 
				I hope to share some of my knowledge and experiences though this platform. I will also post and share new updates on my LinkedIn profile(click below!) on occasion, so do connect with me there!
