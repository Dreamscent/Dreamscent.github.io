[VirtualHackingLabs][1] is touted as a close copy of the PWK labs by Offensive Security. In my journey for the OSCP certification, I signed up for 3 months of lab access. I actually only plan to use 1 month of it, but that's a story for another time.

Initial impressions were good, the lab materials provided was 370 pages of reasonably high quality material. In the coming weeks I will post some updates on my progress and my thoughts on the overall experience.

As of the date of posting, the labs contain a total of 41 Machines:

- Beginner: 9
- Advanced: 17
- Advanced+: 15

They provide 2 certificates of completion, which I will look into attaining during this period:

1. Certificate of Completion: Root 20 machines and provide documentation
2. Advanced+ Certificate of Completion: Root 10 Advanced+ machines, AND any 2 others manually. The 2 must be previously rooted with metasploit or publicly available scripts. So basically you have to re-root them without such exploit scripts, which may be a challenge.
