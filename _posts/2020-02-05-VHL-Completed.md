Disclaimer: This post is still a Work in Progress

I may be behind schedule, but I have completed both Virtual Hacking Labs Certifications. Those who know me in real life would know that I had some issues in real life which affected my morale late last year. This eventually led to me missing out completing both certifications by 3 Advanced+ machines. An extension was made for 1 month for report writing(and redoing screenshots if needed).
