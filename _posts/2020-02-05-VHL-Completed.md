I may be behind schedule in what I initially planned last year, but I have completed both Virtual Hacking Labs Certifications. Those who know me personally would know that I had some issues in real life which affected my morale late last year. This eventually led to me missing out completing both certifications by 3 Advanced+ machines. An extension was made for 1 month for report writing(and redoing screenshots if needed).

In summary, the [Virtualhackinglabs][1] course is truly quite an experience. For the price, it definitely is a worthwhile starting point for people looking into obtaining the OSCP, to taste what it has to offer. However, if you you have some prior knowledge of the general methodolgies, and a familiarity in the linux operating system, a 3 month subscription to PWK is definitely sufficient. The advantage of having an extra VHL is the chance to take a break in between, as having a full 3 month commitment to PWK can be mentally exhausting for some.

Lab machines were fairly well designed, with a wide range of difficulties(over 40 machines were available at the time of writing). Most were in my opinion, easy to medium in terms of difficulty. Even some of the Advanced+ were fairly easy and directly gave root shells when exploited. But take this with a a pinch of salt, because I have been dabbling and preparing for at least 6 months prior to this, achieving "Hacker" rank in [Hackthebox][2]. Because our experiences and background are different, YMMV.

Now, I'm going on to the next step and trying the [PWK][3] course, and looking into finally attempting the OSCP. If you have any questions, do feel free to reach out to me by sending me a message on LinkedIn(I'll work on new avenues of contacting in the future)!
