## Work in progress - Come back later to read the full story

So as we may know, all drivers to Malaysia now require a Vehicle Entry Permit ("VEP") to enter the country. The VEP I refer to here is an ugly tamper-proof RFID tag to be affixed on a vehicle. The Malaysian Transport Department ("JPJ") has appointed a shithole of a company "TCSENS" to handle all VEP matters.



They offer 2 options for VEP collection: Self collect, where you have to drive across the causeway and have it installed, or by mail, where you pay an admittedly high sum(RM58.26 ~=  SG$17-18) for the worst delivery experience. More on that later.



Here is my story of the sheer nightmare having to deal with the clown fest that is the holy trinity of JPJ, TCSENS, and City Link Express.



As of time of writing, it has been approximately 1 year and I still have not received my stupid VEP tag.



Before we start, let's look at a poster from what I suspect is from their hiring campaign when looking for staff to fill the roles in this "supply chain". This will give you a sense of better sense of what I have to deal with.
